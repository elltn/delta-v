For workflow we are using VSCode with the following extensions:
- Live Server (can host the client index.html in browser to dev locally)
- Live Sass Compiler (to automatically compile SCSS into CSS for the live server)
- es6-string-html (highlights HTML in template literals)
- es6-string-javascript (highlights JS in template literals)
